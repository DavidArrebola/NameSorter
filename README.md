# NameSorter        
Welcome to Dave's name sorter, to sort custom names first you will need to fork then repo,
then add a .txt file to NameSorter/bin/UnsortedFiles with names listed each on their own line using alphabetical characters and 
from there just run the console app and press 'y' to run the program.
